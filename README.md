## The Tech Behind the Flavor
We've developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built on Elasticsearch. This solution leverages Elasticsearch's hybrid search capabilities (combining full-text and vector search) to accurately retrieve information from diverse data sources, enhancing precision compared to semantic search alone. Our approach integrates the contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Elasticsearch's robust search functionality, delivering personalized restaurant and meal suggestions while minimizing inaccurate responses.

We employ a Langchain agent powered by an LLM to interpret user intent and execute tasks. These tasks include customizing functions like geocoding and using the Elasticsearch tool to gather restaurant data, synthesize information, and generate tailored responses.
